          <span>Amethi</span>
          is a town in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is a major town of
          the Amethi district, in the Faizabad division. The Hanumangarhi temple
          is located near the town.
          The town is part of the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, which became
          reputed as a stronghold of the Indian National Congress party. The
          Congress leaders belonging to Nehru-Gandhi family won several
          elections from Amethi during 1980-2014.
          Amethi during the 1980s was very different from the Amethi of today.
          In the 1980s, it was considered to be amongst the most backward
          regions in the country. Upholding the pro development and inclusive
          spirit of the Congress Party, Rajiv Gandhi decided to focus his
          attention and work towards ameliorating the situation of the people of
          Amethi. This is why he chose to contest elections from Amethi and was
          elected as an MP for two terms from 1981. He continued to represent
          the constituency until his death in 1991. In a span of 10 years,
          Amethi witnessed drastic developments on all fronts- agriculture, law
          and order, health and education, industrialisation as well as
          connectivity. One of the most significant achievements was in the
          field of agriculture where wide expanses of infertile, alkaline land
          were transformed into lush green farms with good productivity.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, Amethi used to be called Raipur-Amethi. Raipur is the
          place where the fort of Raja of Amethi. His ancestors used to reside
          in Raipur-Phulwari, where the old fort is still there. Amethi is also
          famous for the temple called Hanumangarhi and a mosque both built
          about hundred years ago. About three kilometres north of Amethi there
          is a tomb of famous poet which is in Ram Nagar, Saint Malik Muhammad
          Jayasi where he died, and the fort was built by Bachghoti Rajas.

          Over the next decade, Congress MPs from Amethi continued to advance
          the work done by Rajiv Gandhi and contributed towards its development.
          When Rahul Gandhi began his political career, he decided to continue
          to work for the people of Amethi and has been representing the
          constituency as an MP for three consecutive terms since 2004. In his
          vision for Amethi, he highlighted three main focus areas education,
          agriculture and connectivity.

          Rahul Gandhi’s attention to education is rooted in his firm belief
          that a good education is the foundation of development in any society.
          For the progress of any region and upward mobility of its people,
          education is a prerequisite. The Congress President’s focus has been
          to provide quality education to every student in his constituency by
          prioritising investments in a robust network of primary education and
          establishing world class institutes. He has transformed the face of
          education in Amethi, setting up five institutes of higher and
          specialised education.
