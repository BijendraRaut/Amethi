				<p class="anu"><b><i><span>Amethi</span></i></b> is a town in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is a
					major town of
					the Amethi district, in the Faizabad division. The Hanumangarhi temple is located near the town.
					<br />
					The town is part of the Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, which became reputed as a stronghold of the
					Indian National
					Congress party. The Congress leaders belonging to Nehru-Gandhi family won several elections from
					Amethi during
					1980-2014.
					<br />
					Amethi during the 1980s was very different from the Amethi of today. In the 1980s, it was considered
					to be amongst
					the most backward regions in the country. Upholding the pro development and inclusive spirit of the
					Congress Party,
					Rajiv Gandhi decided to focus his attention and work towards ameliorating the situation of the
					people of Amethi.
					This is why he chose to contest elections from Amethi and was elected as an MP for two terms from
					1981.
					He continued to represent the constituency until his death in 1991. In a span of 10 years, Amethi
					witnessed
					drastic developments on all fronts- agriculture, law and order, health and education,
					industrialisation as well
					as connectivity. One of the most significant achievements was in the field of agriculture where wide
					expanses of
					infertile, alkaline land were transformed into lush green farms with good productivity.

				<h2>&#128513 History</h2>
				</li>

				<p class="abhi">In the past, Amethi used to be called Raipur-Amethi. Raipur is the place where the fort
					of Raja of
					Amethi. His ancestors used to reside in Raipur-Phulwari, where the old fort is still there. Amethi
					is also
					famous for the temple called Hanumangarhi and a mosque both built about hundred years ago. About
					three
					kilometres north of Amethi there is a tomb of famous poet which is in Ram Nagar, Saint Malik
					Muhammad Jayasi
					where he died, and the fort was built by Bachghoti Rajas.

				<p class="singh">Over the next decade, Congress MPs from Amethi continued to advance the work done by
					Rajiv Gandhi and
					contributed towards its development. When Rahul Gandhi began his political career, he decided to
					continue to work
					for the people of Amethi and has been representing the constituency as an MP for three consecutive
					terms since
					2004. In his vision for Amethi, he highlighted three main focus areas education, agriculture and
					connectivity.
					<br />
					Rahul Gandhi’s attention to education is rooted in his firm belief that a good education is the
					foundation of
					development in any society. For the progress of any region and upward mobility of its people,
					education is a
					prerequisite. The Congress President’s focus has been to provide quality education to every student
					in his
					constituency by prioritising investments in a robust network of primary education and establishing
					world class
					institutes. He has transformed the face of education in Amethi, setting up five institutes of higher
					and
					specialised education.
