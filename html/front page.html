					famous for the temple called Hanumangarhi and a mosque both built about hundred years ago. About three

				<p class="singh">Over the next decade, Congress MPs from Amethi continued to advance the work done by Rajiv Gandhi and 
					contributed towards its development. When Rahul Gandhi began his political career, he decided to continue to work 
					for the people of Amethi and has been representing the constituency as an MP for three consecutive terms since
					2004. In his vision for Amethi, he highlighted three main focus areas education, agriculture and connectivity.
					<br />
					Rahul Gandhi’s attention to education is rooted in his firm belief that a good education is the foundation of 
					development in any society. For the progress of any region and upward mobility of its people, education is a 
					prerequisite. The Congress President’s focus has been to provide quality education to every student in his 
					constituency by prioritising investments in a robust network of primary education and establishing world class 
					institutes. He has transformed the face of education in Amethi, setting up five institutes of higher and 
					specialised education.
